                            <h2><strong>What is Pest Control?</strong></h2>
                            <p>Pest control is a process used in hygiene management that looks to manage the existence and
                                presence of different types of pests to minimise their impact on the environment they
                                inhabit. Whilst many pests pose a risk to human health when they are present in places such
                                as homes and retail or food preparation environments, it is also important to consider their
                                place in wider food chains and habitats, which is why some pest populations are
                                &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; instead of just eliminated.</p>
                            <p>Pest control technicians are professionals that are tasked with finding and implementing the
                                best solutions for removing or controlling pest populations to make a range of environments
                                safe. Because of the potential harm that the improper use of pest control methods can cause,
                                the professional is regulated by best practice codes and the equipment or products needed
                                for pest control are only available to those with appropriate qualifications and experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>There are a variety of pieces of legislation connected with pest control that impacts what
                                needs to be done and the appropriate ways to go about dealing with infestations of different
                                kinds of pests. One of the most important of these is the &lsquo;<span

                                            Public Health Act</strong></span></a>&rsquo; (1961) gives local authorities the
                                power to issue a notice for immediate action to be taken if a premise is considered to be

                            <h2><strong>Types of Pest</strong></h2>
                            <p>There are a wide variety of different types of pest that require official pest control
                                measures, but all of these can be roughly divided into the following three categories.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Insects</strong></h3>
                            <p>Insect infestations are perhaps the most common pest control issues in both domestic and
                                commercial premises, especially as most species are so small that it takes a while to notice
                                when a serious infestation has taken place. Common insect pests include ants, cockroaches,
                                bedbugs, fleas, and wasps or bees.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Rodents</strong></h3>
                            <p>Rodents tend to be what people first think of when it comes to pests. Whilst rats are one of
                                the most common pests, mice are also a problem that pest control is sometimes called out to
                                deal with, especially in food or catering businesses.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Birds and Others</strong></h3>
                            <p>Birds and other kinds of animals are the least common pests, but can still cause issues and
                                pose a threat to the health and safety of a business and its customers. Pigeons and seagulls
                                are common bird pests, whilst creatures like foxes and squirrels can also cause serious
                                problems in large numbers.</p>
                            <h2><strong>3 Types of Pest Control Methods</strong></h2>
                            <p>Pest control services use a variety of approaches to deal with infestations, but these can be
                                sorted into three main types of pest management, which we will explain in detail below.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Physical</strong></h3>
                            <p>Physical pest control involves the trapping and killing or removal of pests to remove them
                                from an environment. It may also involve putting up physical barriers and &lsquo;pest
                                proofing&rsquo; premises to stop pests from returning or entering in the first place.</p>
                            <p>Common examples of physical pest control include removing or destroying nests, blocking
                                holes, windows or doorways, temperature control methods to kill pests, or setting traps to
                                catch pests and then remove them from the area. In farming, methods such as field burning
                                and trap cropping are also common physical control methods.</p>
                            <h4><strong>Advantages</strong></h4>
                            <ul class="ticks">
                                <li aria-level="1">The biggest advantage of this kind of pest control method is that it
                                    doesn&rsquo;t involve any kind of dangerous chemicals that can have an impact on the
                                    environment or an individual that accidentally comes into contact with a substance used
                                    for pest control</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">These methods are also usually environmentally friendly</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">Physical pest management is also a method that pests cannot develop any
                                    kind of resistance to, which means its an approach that will always be as effective as
                                    possible</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h4>
                            <ul class="ticks">
                                <li aria-level="1">A key disadvantage of physical pest control that involves trapping is
                                    that many people believe that it is inhumane to trap animals and remove them from their
                                    natural habitat, even if this is done with health and safety in mind</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">Physical pest control that involves killing pests is also considered to
                                    be inhumane, particularly when they are rodents or larger creatures</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">On a practical level, if you have a large infestation then physically
                                    removing all of the pests will be a very tricky and time-consuming task, so its
                                    effectiveness is not as high as other methods</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">This method isn&rsquo;t also a very reliable approach to stopping pests
                                    from returning to their original infestation site</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3><strong>Chemical</strong></h3>
                            <p>Chemical pest control methods are the most widely used approach to pest control. They are
                                also commonly used to control weed infestations and diseases in crops.</p>
                            <p>Pesticides are the name used to describe chemical pest control substances, which usually
                                poison and kill the pest that consumes or is exposed to them. These may be used in
                                combination with physical traps or just be left out in places where pests are known to be.
                                Only qualified pest control technicians can and should have access to chemical pesticides,
                                as these substances are toxic and can be incredibly harmful if ingested by a human.</p>
                            <p>Another chemical pest control method is ultra-low volume (ULV) fogging, which is used to
                                combat insect infestations and spreads small amounts of insecticide. On the opposite end of
                                the scale, fumigation is an extreme chemical pest control method that involves sealing a
                                building and filling it with pesticide to annihilate any pest on the premises.</p>
                            <h4><strong>Advantages</strong></h4>
                            <ul class="ticks">
                                <li aria-level="1">The main advantage of chemical pest control is that it is very effective
                                    and yields relatively fast results when it comes to removing pests</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">Pesticides are also quite a cheap method of pest management, with very
                                    weak substances available to purchase for people without pest control qualifications
                                </li>
                                <li aria-level="1">Chemical pest control methods are also pretty quick and simple to use
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h4>
                            <ul class="ticks">
                                <li aria-level="1">Almost all chemical pesticides are highly toxic and can cause serious
                                    issues if ingested by things that aren't pests, such as household pets and even people
                                </li>
                                <li aria-level="1">Frequent and heavy use of chemical pesticides can contaminate groundwater
                                    or leave residue on plants which can lead to health issues</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">It is possible for pests to develop resistance to chemical pesticides,
                                    which can cause major issues when it comes to trying to control this new resistant
                                    species</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3><strong>Biological</strong></h3>
                            <p>The last of the 3 methods of pest control is biological methods which is one of the oldest
                                forms of pest management. This consists of using other natural organisms to reduce or remove
                                a species of pest, which usually involves introducing their natural predator to the same
                                environment to manage the pest population. It&rsquo;s not commonly used as a method of
                                dealing with pests in a health and safety context, but may be used to control larger
                                populations of pests which could pose a risk to those who live in the same area.</p>
                            <p>Natural predators are one form of biological pest control method, but another that tends to
                                be used on plants is the introduction of microorganisms that protect their host species by
                                deterring any pests.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4><strong>Advantages</strong></h4>
                            <ul class="ticks">
                                <li aria-level="1">Biological pest control is generally the most environmentally-friendly
                                    method you can use, as it doesn&rsquo;t involve any kind of synthetic substance or the
                                    killing or removal of a species by humans</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">It&rsquo;s also a long-term solution which means that pest control is
                                    usually only needed once</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">Introducing a natural predator as a way of controlling pests also
                                    doesn&rsquo;t require much cost or effort after the initial introduction, so it&rsquo;s
                                    a method that essentially looks after itself</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h4>

                                <li aria-level="1">Biological pest control is not a particularly reliable method because you
                                    cannot dictate how a predatory species is going to act when introduced into a new area
                                </li>
                                <li aria-level="1">It&rsquo;s not a very fast process so isn&rsquo;t suitable for instances
                                    where a pest infestation needs to be quickly dealt with, nor does it totally wipe out a
                                    pest population</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">In some cases, introducing a new species into an environment can disrupt

                                    predatory creature, which will then need to be reduced or removed</li>
